# Phonetic Spelling

## Introduction

Phonetic spelling involves representing words based on their sounds rather than their standard orthography. This is particularly helpful for AI voice-over software, as it can struggle with words that deviate from standard pronunciation patterns. By transcribing words phonetically, we can bridge the gap between written text and spoken language, leading to a more natural and accurate voice-over. There are multiple phonetic spelling systems, with various levels of usefulness and complexity. However, many of these systems have a steep learning curve and are relatively unintuitive. For example, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is based on Latin script, which is understandably unfamiliar to many audiences. Thankfully, WellsaidLabs has spared us the Latin and developed a more intuitive system for phonetic re-spellings. This is helpful but not entirely positive. It means that simply googling a phonetic spelling will not give you the result you are looking for, and learning how it works is more critical.

## The WellsaidLabs System

The WellsaidLabs system uses 12 vowel sounds, 6 vowel combination sounds, and 27 consonant sounds. The full chart can be found here: [https://help.wellsaidlabs.com/respellings-reference-charts](https://help.wellsaidlabs.com/respellings-reference-charts)
This chart guides you through combining the pieces of words to create your own phonetic spellings.

Each syllable should be separated by a dash, and the stressed syllables should be written in capital letters. WellsaidLabs provides 2 levels of stress when phonetically spelling a word. For our purposes, "stress" can be thought of as emphasis. For example:

`a-BOUT:` (Stress on the second syllable)

`HA-ppi-ness:` (Stress on the first syllable)

If you are familiar with the IPA, you will notice that IPA has one additional level of stress. While this inevitably results in some loss of precision, it makes the system more intuitive.

Examples:

"Measure" becomes `MEH-zhur`

"Duck" becomes `DUHK`

This can be tricky at first, but with some practice, it can become relatively intuitive. Start by picking out any word you would like to practice with. Open the reference chart above and start sounding out your word. Go one syllable at a time, looking up each sound on the chart. Say the word out loud a couple of times and notice where you place the most emphasis. There are a couple of example words written out for you on the chart. Try picking a couple of words without looking at the proper phonetic spelling before writing down what you think the answer is.



WellsaidLabs currently does not support nasal sounds or a glottal stop. 


# TODO:

## Acronyms

Acronyms are frequently mispronounced by AI narrators so they will frequently require phonetic replacement. In general there are two types of Acronyms, the first is the word form:

**FOMO:** "Fear Of Missing Out"

The second is the letter form:

**DOJ:** "Department of Justice".
