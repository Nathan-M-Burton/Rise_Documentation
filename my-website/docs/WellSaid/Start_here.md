# Starting WellSaid Labs

Welcome to WellSaid Labs! WellSaid will be the voice behind the videos you create, so mastering it is important to ensure the timely production of videos. This tutorial covers the basics of starting your journey with WellSaid Labs.

## 1. Log In or Sign Up

Before you can dive in, you'll need a WellSaid Labs account:

* **Existing Users:** Head over to [WellSaid Labs](https://wellsaidlabs.com/) and click on the `Log In` button to access your account.
* **New to WellSaid Labs?** Click on the `Try for free` or `Sign up` button. If you are affiliated with the University of Oregon, use the appropriate channels to request access.

## 2. Exploring the Interface

Once you're in, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the WellSaid Labs interface:

* **Projects:** This is where you'll manage all your voiceover projects.
* **Voices:** There are a wide array of diverse AI voices. While no single voice works in all situations, I often have luck with **Terra G.** or **Wade C.**
* **Pronunciation:** This allows you to replace commonly mispronounced words or phrases with phonetic spellings.

## 3. Creating Your First Voiceover

Now for the exciting part! Let's create your first voiceover:

1. **Start a New Project:** Click on the `Create new project` button.
2. **Name Your Project:** Give your project a memorable name.
3. **Enter Your Script:** Type directly into the script editor or paste text from another source.
4. **Choose Your Voice:** Listen to samples and select the perfect voice for your project.
5. **Adjust Pronunciation (Optional):** Fine-tune pronunciation using the built-in tools.
6. **Generate Audio:** Click the `Generate` button.

## 4. Downloading and Using Your Audio

Once the audio is ready:

1. **Preview:** Review the voiceover and listen for any audio irregularities.
2. **Download:** Choose your preferred audio format (MP3 or WAV) and click the `Download` button.
3. **Integrate:** You have now generated your first AI voiceover! You can practice on some other scripts or move to the next steps.

## 5. Tips for Success

* **Write Naturally:** Try to write like you speak. The AI has no context outside of the text you provide, so read the text aloud before generating.
* **Punctuation:** Over punctuate. Commas, periods, and question marks all help create natural pauses and inflections. Even if the grammar is incorrect, it can still help the AI understand where pauses should be.
* **Experiment with Voices:** Don't be afraid to try different voices! Sometimes certain voices are just not a good fit for the script you are working on.
