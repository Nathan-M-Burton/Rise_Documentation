This is particularly helpful for AI voice-over software, as it can struggle with words that deviate from standard pronunciation patterns. By transcribing words phonetically, we can bridge the gap between written text and spoken language, leading to a more natural and accurate voice-over. There are multiple phonetic spelling systems, with various levels of usefulness and complexity. However, many of these systems have a steep learning curve and are relatively unintuitive. For example, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is based on Latin script, which is understandably unfamiliar to many audiences. Thankfully, WellsaidLabs has spared us the Latin and developed a more intuitive system for phonetic re-spellings. This is helpful but not entirely positive. It means that simply googling a phonetic spelling will not give you the result you are looking for, and learning how it works is more critical."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(s.h2,{id:"the-wellsaidlabs-system",children:"The WellsaidLabs System"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(s.p,{children:["The WellsaidLabs system uses 12 vowel sounds, 6 vowel combination sounds, and 27 consonant sounds.
